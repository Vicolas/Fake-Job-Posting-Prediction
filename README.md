**Fake Job Posting Prediction**

This Machine Learning project involves developing a model that can detect fraudulent job postings with the aim to help job seekers avoid falling prey to scams and to help companies identify and eliminate fraudulent job listings.

The steps involves building a fake job posting prediction model with a dataset of job postings that have been labeled as both real and fake include: 
A dataset was made available by She Code Africa.
Once a dataset had been collected, cleaned and preprocessed, which involved removing irrelevant or redundant features and transforming the remaining features into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Next, a suitable machine learning algorithm was selected and trained on the preprocessed dataset. 

The chosen algorithm is a binary classifier that outputs either as 0 or a 1, indicating whether a job posting is real or fake. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Some of the features that may be used to train the model include the job title, company information, job description, salary information, location, and contact information. These features may be analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful information that can be used to differentiate between real and fake job postings.

Overall, the fake job posting prediction project is a challenging and important task that requires expertise in data collection, preprocessing, machine learning, and NLP.
